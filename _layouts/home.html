    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p style="max-width: 800px;">
      Hello! I'm Dongze Li, a postgraduate student in Robotics at the University of Manchester, specializing in ROS2, robotic perception, and intelligent control systems. 
      My research interests lie in visual recognition, autonomous navigation, and human-robot interaction.
    </p>
    <p style="max-width: 800px;">
      Throughout my master's program, I have participated in various projects ranging from sensor data processing to the development of multi-robot systems using ROS2, 
      gaining solid hands-on experience along the way. I enjoy bridging ideas across disciplines and am particularly passionate about applying intelligent robotic 
      technologies to real-world challenges.
    </p>
    <p style="max-width: 800px;">
      I'm currently seeking internship opportunities or research collaborations â€” feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or discuss ideas!
    </p>
    
    <h3>Research Interests</h3>
    <p>
      My research interests lie primarily in the fields of <strong>computer vision</strong> and <strong>robotics</strong>. 
      I am especially interested in how visual perception can empower intelligent robotic systems to better interact with and understand their environments. 
      I aim to explore topics such as scene understanding, object detection, and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) in future work.
    </p>
