<h2>UAV image matching technology integrating deep learning features</h2>
<p>
The Geodesc method was studied, which uses a network structure based on L2-Net and 
trains the model on the GL3D dataset. Then we applied Geodesc to the UAV image matching task.
The following figure is a comparison of the performance of the feature point matching Geodesc method and SIFT method.

<h2>Face Recognition</h2>
<p>Based on the LBPH algorithm in the opencv library, data collection is 
achieved through the camera. After training, the model can recognize people in the camera.
