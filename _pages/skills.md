## ðŸ§  Technical Skills

### Python (Proficiency: 8/10)
Extensive experience using Python across both undergraduate and postgraduate projects.  
- Built a face recognition system, blood cell classification, and a data mining competition solution.  
- Developed a deep learning-based UAV image matching system for the undergraduate thesis using Geodesc.  
- Currently applying Python for object detection and UAV attitude control in postgraduate research.  
Python is my primary development language, particularly for robotics control and computer vision.

### ROS2 (Proficiency: 6/10)
Hands-on experience building a complete robotic system for autonomous navigation and target grasping.  
- Designed a full ROS2 pipeline integrating sensor input, perception, and motion planning.  
- Implemented topic-based communication between system nodes for real-time robot coordination.

### PyTorch (Proficiency: 5/10)
Used PyTorch to train the Geodesc deep feature descriptor during the undergraduate thesis.  
- Trained on the GL3D dataset and compared the descriptor's matching performance against SIFT.

### OpenCV (Proficiency: 6/10)
- Applied OpenCV in real-time face recognition using the LBPH algorithm.  
- Used OpenCV for object detection from depth cameras, feature extraction, and visualization.

### Gazebo / RViz (Proficiency: 4/10)
- Simulated robot navigation and SLAM in Gazebo environments.  
- Visualized mapping and sensor data using RViz.

### C++ (Proficiency: 6/10)
- Built a student score management system with C++ during undergraduate studies.  
- Familiar with object-oriented programming and foundational data structures.  
- Used alongside Python for robotics, but Python is currently the main development language.

### CAD Tools (SolidWorks / Fusion 360) (Proficiency: 3/10)
- Modeled sensor brackets and robot components using SolidWorks and Fusion 360.  
- Designed printable mechanical parts for robotic integration.
